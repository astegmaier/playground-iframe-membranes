This scenario illustrates what happens when the reference to the iframe is leaked directly by the main window. You can see that _only_ leaking the `HTMLIframeElement` (but _not_ the associated `contentWindow`) is not a big deal because the iframe's realm will still get garbage collected (i.e. all the bigObject arrays that get created will be cleaned up).
