This is a slight adaptation of [the example membrane from the tc39 unit test suite](https://github.com/tc39/test262/blob/main/implementation-contributed/v8/mjsunit/es6/proxies-example-membrane.js) (see solution 5), modified to use Proxy.revocable. This change means that revoking the membrane has the desired effect on garbage collection because all references between the dry and wet realms are severed on revokation.
